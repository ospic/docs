## About
Ospic mobile application is automated mobile support that auto-detect client information from any hospital where they get service (i.e The user is required to download the mobile application and sign-up with the email address and then use the same email in any hospital which uses the Ospic HMS). Then the algorithm will automatically populate the patient information to his account. 

## For Multiple hospitals
If the user attended service in hospital A and next time in hospital B the only thing required is to register with the same email address in both hospitals. There will be no need for users to have separate mobile applications or separate accounts for two hospitals. The algorithm and mobile application provide an option for users to switch between hospitals A and B.

## Clients mobile app or account
In case you attended medical service in a hospital which uses Ospic HMS and you have not registered in our app just remember to register with your valid email address. Once you are registered with a valid email we can assure your information will be available immediately once you register and log in next time.
