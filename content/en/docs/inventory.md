The aim is to minimize the manual work for Blood bank and  [Blood groups](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/blood-groups/) management. All blood groups were defined in the system and its definition considered blood groups and their RH factor as explained [here](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/blood-groups/).  The blood bank give the list of available blood groups and their stock and option to edit.
