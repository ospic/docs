**Medical services** means medical and health care services provided to an individual, including, but not limited to, medical and health care services provided to a Person which are covered by a policy of insurance, and includes, without limitation, physician services, nurse and therapist services, dental services, hospital services, skilled nursing facility services, comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation services, home health care services, residential and out-patient behavioral healthcare services, and medicine or health care equipment provided to a Person for a necessary or specifically requested valid and proper medical or health purpose.

### Medical categories
---
In previous versions we have categorized medical service in two categories **Laboratory and Radiology** but this was not good approach as medical institutions differ in service depend on their sizes. So we decided to change medical service categories to customized one, i.e user can add or delete the medical service categories of their choice. 

### Add medical service categories
---
From your navigaton drawer navigate to Medical service > Service categories, this will list all available medical services <c-image src="categories.png" alt="Medical service categories"></c-imag>

Click <strong class="button"><v-icon x-small color="white">mdi-plus</v-icon>Add new medical service category</strong> button and  fill required form fields in popup screen and click save. On success the service categories will be updated. Use the created medical service under given category.
