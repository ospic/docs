#### HomePage
Ospic deals with human confidential information. With this understanding we have implemented strict Authorization and Authentication methods just to make sure that the one using the system is exactly who is pretending to be and is allowed to perform what operation is trying to perfom. Soon after installation the database comes with default user for testing `username = demo` and `password=password`. The system admin can navigate to [Settings and configurations](/docs/a/#settings-and-configurations) to create a new user, assign them roles then login.
