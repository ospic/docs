## Getting started

Now on our page we can see we have an object with a variable property which is an empty array and a body variable which has our h1 and p tag as well as some other info that we will look at later. If we scroll down you will see we have all the other variables that we have access to.

## Authentication

Ospic deals with human confidential information. With this understanding we have implemented strict Authorization and Authentication methods just to make sure that the one using the system is exactly who is pretending to be and is allowed to perform what operation is trying to perfom. Soon after installation the database comes with default user for testing `username = demo` and `password=password`. The system admin can navigate to [Settings and configurations](/docs#settings-and-configurations) to create a new user, assign them roles then login.
